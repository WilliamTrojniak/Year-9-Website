          <h1>Affordable and Clean Energy</h1>
          <p>
            Affordable and clean energy is an incredibly impactful goal to reach for many reasons. Currently, energy production is the major contributor to global greenhouse gasses. Not only this, current sources are non-renewable and therefore unsustainable. By using renewable energy sources, we increase our population's sustainability. Finally, 13% of the worlds population lacks access to electricity whatsoever, a modern dependancy in today's world. This has lead to millions of deaths due to air pollution from burning fuels for heat in place of electric heating.

        <div class = "secondSlideElement textblock">
          <h1>How does changing our sources of energy help the environment?</h1>
          <p>
            Energy production is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, about 60% of all greenhouse gas emissions per year are generated when producing energy. These gases are extremely harmful to the environment and are a main factor behind climate change. What's worse, these harmful gases are being emitted at a higher rate than ever before. However, by eliminating energy sources such as fossil fuels, that release plenty of greenhouse gases, and replacing them with clean, renewable energy sources, such as windmills which harness the wind to produce energy without creating any harmful biproducts, levels of greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to be reduced drastically. By doing this, we can help to slow and mitigate the effects of climate change.

          <h1>Climate Action</h1>
          <p>
            But why does climate change need to be addressed? Climate change affects all aspects of life for everyone. Huge areas of ice are melting as a result of global temperatures increasing, leading to rising sea levels and loss of habitats. Places once suitable to farm are becoming infertile, droughts and heatwaves are becoming more frequent, precipitation patterns are changing, natural disasters are becoming more powerful, and more. All of these effects pose serious risk to the health and wellbeing of all habitants of Earth, and so it is extremely important that action be taken to mitigate these effects, so that their impacts are lessened.
